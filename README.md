# Fast ai notes

These notes are my personal insights about creating machine learning models, deep learning practices and concepts. These are based on the Fast ai's courses 

1) Intro to Machine Learning
2) Practical Deep Learning for Coders
3) From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion

These are usually implementations of various interesting machine learning and deep learning concepts and practices using PyTorch and fastai library.

I sincerely thank Jeremy Howard for these amazing courses, which played a huge role in forming my core foundations in deep learning.
